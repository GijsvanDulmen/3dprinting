# Flow Calibration

See First startup section first.

# Textured PEI
Make sure the initial flow is a bit lower as normal flow.
Top flow probably a bit higher

Example for TitanX:
- Normal: 94.5%
- Top: 97.5%
- Initial layer: 91.0%

# Speed
If speeds are exceeding > 170mm/s on my Voron V0 I needed to tweak flow to somewhat higher numbers.
